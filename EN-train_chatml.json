Also, modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle.   Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller, simpler problems and solving them.

oriented programming\n\n    For the above question the reference answer is : \n    This type of programming is more flexible making it easier to add and modify the program It is also a type of a fail safe program you check each individual module This eliminates redundant code and makes the program easier to read for other programmers When debugging the program it is easier to track down the source of a problem within a module rather than a 2 million line program\n\n    Now a student has provided the below answer : \n    Coding and Debugging programs are usually easier as either the compiler will specify the object that is working incorrectly or the function an object was assigned to will be easier to identify The code itself also looks more organized and is easier to read and will help to avoid redundant coding Post - programming maintenance is also easier Also modules can be reused several times in other programs without too much hassle Abstraction is the art of breaking down one big problem into smaller simpler problems and solving them Many of the smaller problems are shared between unique complex problems and creating modules to these solve these smaller repeated problems can save time when you encounter them again\n\n    For the above answer, what is the appropriate score you will provide on a score of 1 to 5 with a\n    precision of 0.5.\n    "}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\n  Score : 5.0\n  "}], [{"role": "user", "content": "\n  The give question is : \n    What does the star -

This is because a binary operator (like '+') is written in between its two operands (as in \"a + b\").  There are two alternative forms of notation used in certain situations.  One is prefix notation, in which an operator is written before its operands.  In prefix notation, the sum of a and b is written \"+ a b\".  This is the notation used to write function calls in mathematics and computer science.  It is also used in the Lisp and Scheme programming languages.  In postfix notation, an operator is written after its operands.  The sum of a and b is written \"a b +\".  (You may have seen this as \"reverse Polish notation\".)  Postfix notation forms the conceptual basis for the way that arithmetic expressions are evaluated by a computer.

theoretically you could do it two ways one of which uses more processing power and memory no larger than the queue is ever at when full and the other which uses almost infinite memory The more practical method would be two place the items in an array and remove the item in position one of the array after which you can shift the array and add another element if required The other option which can use infinite memory when used for long term queues such as job scheduling that goes nonstop for extended periods that is to implement an array and add the items read item one raise your
